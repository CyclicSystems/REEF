This code was created as part of a project to model Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) data at the survey level. Simulation code examins multiple methods for imputing abundance information (collected by reef as 0, 1, 2-10, 11-100, and 101+ categories) into regression models. It also contains code used to model real world REEF data using the best methods found through simulation, and comparing results from real world application with models applied to the same data using a binomial and multinomial interpretation. Feel free to use or adopt the simulated code for your own work in accordance with the liscencing statement in this repository. The code for modeling real world data is meant to be paired with REEF data, which can be acquired with permission from https://www.reef.org/.
